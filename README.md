## Architecture

This project follows the VIPER architecture, which stands for:

1. **V**iew: Responsible for displaying the data and responding to user inputs.
2. **I**nteractor: Manages the business logic.
3. **P**resenter: Serves as an intermediary between the view and the interactor.
4. **E**ntity: Represents the data models.
5. **R**outer: Handles navigation and wireframes.

The VIPER architecture encourages separation of concerns and modularity in your code, making it easier to maintain and extend your application.
